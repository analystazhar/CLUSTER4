    "    (e.g., homogeneity, completeness, and the V-measure), the Silhouette Coefficient can be used when ground truth \n",
    "    information is not available. This makes it applicable to unsupervised clustering scenarios.\n",

    "Homogeneity, completeness, and the V-measure are three clustering evaluation metrics that are closely related and provide \n",
    "insights into different aspects of clustering quality. They are calculated based on the agreement between clustering results \n",
    "and ground truth class labels (if available). Here's how they are related and whether they can have different values for the \n",
    "same clustering result:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Homogeneity:Homogeneity measures the extent to which each cluster contains only data points that are members of a single \n",
    "    class. In other words, it assesses whether the clusters are \"pure\" in the sense that the data points within each cluster \n",
    "    belong to the same ground truth class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Completeness:Completeness measures the extent to which all data points that are members of a given class are assigned to the \n",
    "    same cluster. It assesses whether all members of a true class are grouped together in a single cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. V-Measure:The V-measure is a metric that combines both homogeneity and completeness into a single measure of clustering \n",
    "    quality. It is calculated as the harmonic mean of homogeneity and completeness. The V-measure balances the trade-off between these two aspects of clustering quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between these metrics can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Homogeneity and Completeness:Homogeneity and completeness are complementary metrics. High homogeneity indicates that clusters \n",
    "    are pure and internally consistent with respect to ground truth classes. High completeness indicates that each ground truth \n",
    "    class is well-represented by a cluster. Both metrics emphasize different aspects of clustering quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "-V-Measure:The V-measure combines homogeneity and completeness to provide a balanced measure of clustering quality. It takes \n",
    "    their harmonic mean, ensuring that both metrics contribute equally. The V-measure reflects how well clusters match class \n",
    "    memberships and how well classes are represented by clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Values for the Same Clustering Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the same clustering result, homogeneity, completeness, and the V-measure can have different values. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Homogeneity and completeness can be maximized separately but may not be maximized simultaneously. A clustering result can \n",
    "achieve high homogeneity by creating pure clusters but may not necessarily achieve high completeness if it doesn't group all \n",
    "members of each class into a single cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The V-measure takes into account both homogeneity and completeness by considering their harmonic mean. Therefore, \n",
    "   the V-measure can have a value that reflects the balance between the two metrics. It will be high when both homogeneity and completeness are high, but it may decrease if one metric is high while the other is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while homogeneity, completeness, and the V-measure are related and reflect different aspects of clustering quality, they can have different values for the same clustering result. The V-measure provides a balanced assessment of clustering quality by combining both homogeneity and completeness, making it a valuable metric for evaluating clustering solutions."

    "\n",
    "1.Interpretability:The Silhouette Coefficient provides a numeric score but does not reveal insights into the structure of the \n",

    "\n",
    "4.Cluster Shape:The Silhouette Coefficient assumes that clusters are convex and uniformly distributed, which may not hold for \n",
